1.2 Introduction

This project focuses classifying tumors into malignant (cancerous) or benign (non cancerous) through machine learning algorithms. The data used is from Kaggle titled "Breast Cancer Dataset". 

Subsequently, I used classification metrics to evaluate the performance of the models.

-------------------------------------------------------------
1.3 Requirements for Running the Project

This analysis was done in a Python 3 environment. Specifically, the Anaconda and Jupyter Notebook environment using the following packages:


pandas

numpy

sci-kit learn

matplotlib

seaborn



It is recommended to import the data into your environment from the

provided data file and begin analysis from there. For Python 3 we recommend

importing the CSV as a pandas dataframe. 



To run the notebook, execute the cells in sequence. The main steps include:

- Data Loading and Preprocessing: Ensure your dataset is correctly formatted and loaded.
- Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Wrangling: This is done to ensure high quality of the dataset and also get an understanding of the data.
- Model Definition: Define the models intended for use
- Training the Model: Train the model and tweak the hyper parameters to obtain the best results.
- Evaluating the Model: Use the provided metrics to measure the modelâ€™s performance on unseen test data.
- Model comparison: Run the provided plot visualization script

1.4 Data Tables

The dataset comprises of 32 columns and 569 instances
There are no missing or undefined values in the dataset.

The features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass, basically describing the characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image. The diagnosis column is the outcome with M = Malignant and B = Benign. There are 10 main features of the dataset, which are computed for each cell nucleus. These ten features in the dataset are:

- radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
- texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
- perimeter
- area
- smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
- compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
- concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
- concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
- symmetry 
- fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)

	The mean, standard error (SE), and "worst" or largest (mean of the three largest values) of these features were computed for each image, resulting in 30 continuous features.
